### Getting Started Notes

- This mockup has 4 main parts: the header, banner, main section and the footer.
- You're not given any HTML markup inside of the `<body></body>` tags, first start by outlining the main elements. Once you have done that, you can start implementing the styles. You'll be expected to edit `style.css` to implement the styles.
- The `style.css` and `index.html` files are linked, which you can see in the `<head></head>` tag, so you don't have to worry about that.
- You are expected to use Css Grid to create the page layout, then use FlexBox for the elements inside the grid columns.
- You are expected to use Media Queries to adjust the layout for different tablets and mobile phones and also create the hamburger menu in the header.
